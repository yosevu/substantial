# About these notes

Hello, I'm Yosevu[^yosevu]. These are my notes[^substantial]. They are based on Zettelkasten and the system created by Niklas Luhmann and popularized in the book How to Take Smart Notes by SÃ¶nke Ahrens. The core idea is to use your brain for [what it is good at](/what-brains-are-good-for): networked thought.
