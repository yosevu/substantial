Brains are good for thinking; computers are good for calculating.

Computing is not an analog for thinking. [Computing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/computing#English) is the process of [calculation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/calculate#English) to determine the solution to a problem. It employs specific mathematical processes. [To think](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/think#English), in contrast, is to wonder, to ponder, and to conceive. It is a more general phenomenon than computing that requires a human-like consciousness. Humans can use thinking for mechanical and repetitive tasks in computing, mathematics and other domains, but we gravitate toward the kind of thinking that is characterized by making non-linear connections, pattern recognition, and creative insight.
